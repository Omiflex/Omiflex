ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Omio, a Computer Science and Engineering student with a keen interest in exploring technology and its real-world applications. I enjoy building projects that span across web development, embedded systems, and data management. 
Currently, Iâ€™m working on enhancing my skills in:

**--> Full-stack development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**

**--> Database design and management (MySQL, Chart.js)**

I love collaborating on innovative projects and constantly expanding my skillset. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
